    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Queen Elizabeth's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1926</strong> - Born in London United Kingdom </li>
      <li><strong>1953</strong> - Elizabeth's coronation was held at Westminster Abbey, and was the first coronation to be broadcast live on television.</li>
      <li><strong>1965</strong> - Her first state visit to West Germany. The first official visit there by a British royal since 1913. Her visit marked the 20-year anniversary of the end of World War II, helping to symbolize the reconciliation between the two countries and recognize Germany’s reemergence as a power in Europe and on the world stage.
 </li>
      <li><strong>1966</strong>- Her biggest regret for delaying a visit to the mining disaster that happened at Wales. Though Prince Philip arrived in Aberfan a day after the disaster, the queen herself delayed her visit for over a week, fearing her presence would distract from rescue and recovery efforts. </li>
      <li><strong>1970</strong> - Her first walkabout. During a royal tour of Australia and New Zealand with Philip and Princess Anne in 1970, Elizabeth bucked centuries of royal tradition when she took a casual stroll to greet crowds of people in person, rather than wave to them from a protected distance. </li>
      <li><strong>1977</strong>- Her silver jubilee. She celebrated 25 years on the throne</li>
      <li><strong>1981</strong> Prince Charles the first son of Queen Elizabeth married Lady Diana Spencer. However the marriage was troubled from the very beginning. </li>
      <li><strong>1992</strong> - Annus Horribilis (Latin for a Horrible year) Charles and Diana’s marriage deteriorated and they announced their decision to separate. Prince Andrew, the queen’s second son, and his wife, Sarah Ferguson, also separated, while Anne divorced her husband, Mark Phillips. Late that year, a fire broke out in Windsor Castle, destroying more than 100 rooms.</li>
      <li><strong>1997</strong>- Her response to the death of princess Diana. The queen initially remained at her estate in Balmoral, Scotland, and refused to allow the flag to fly at half-mast over Buckingham Palace or address the grieving nation. 
      
At the urging of her advisers, she soon revised her stance on the flag, returned to London to greet crowds of mourners and delivered a rare televised address to a nation devastated by the loss of the “People’s Princess.”  </li>
      <li><strong>2002</strong> - The queen celebrated her 50th jubilee. </li>
      <li><strong>2013</strong> - The queen welcomed a new great-grandson, Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge, the first child of Prince William and the former Kate Middleton, who married in 2011</li>
      <li><strong>2018</strong> - Prince Harry and Meghan Markle marriage. Though the queen reportedly gave her quick approval to the match, the relationship between the couple and the British media—as well as the rest of the royal family—grew increasingly tense after their marriage. </li>
      <li><strong>2021</strong> - Prince Philip, Elizabeth's husband of 73 years, died at the age of 99. </li>
      <li><strong>2022</strong> - In February of 2022, England began a series of celebrations marking Queen Elizabeth II's 70 years on the throne. The queen watched the pageantry from the balcony of Buckingham Palace and was joined by four generations of her heirs.</li>
      <li><strong>2022</strong> - She died on 8 September 2022. The 96-year-old monarch died of old age.</li>
    </ul>
